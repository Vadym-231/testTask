# TEST TASK

### SIMPLE library to display tournament board (without REST, web services etc...)
#### Install deps and run test cases: `npm i && npm run test`;

#### Here we can import the Tournament class (data stored in memory how was in T/T description) Implementation was creating in TDD styles. 
#### That include methods such as: `finishGame` (mark game statuses like `isActive: false`), `editGame`(edit scores for current game by id), `getGames`(get sorted by scores game), `addGame`(add game with score 0 - 0);

#### So, see my solution and have a nice day! :)
